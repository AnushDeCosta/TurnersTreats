Turner's Treats is a responsive web application for a fictional bakery specializing in artisanal baked goods such as cookies, bread, and cupcakes. The website allows users to explore products, browse a gallery of baked goods, read blog posts about baking, and place orders through an intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts seamlessly across devices, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring that images resize appropriately and content remains accessible. Specific sections, like the Home and About pages, are restructured for better readability on smaller screens, and the gallery adjusts to provide a consistent visual experience.

- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Enhanced user experience through JavaScript features such as form validation, image slideshows, and dynamic navigation.
- **Adapted Layout for Smaller Screens**: On screens smaller than 1920px, images are resized, and the layout is adjusted to enhance user experience. For example, images are centered and reduced in size, and content blocks are stacked vertically to maintain a clear and accessible layout.
- **Media Query Enhancements**: The website uses media queries to ensure that styles are tailored to different devices and screen resolutions. This includes resizing text, images, and buttons, and adjusting the layout for improved usability on devices like phones, tablets, and smaller laptop screens.
